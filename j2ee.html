		<h1><ul>JAVA TO ENTERPRISE EDITION</ul></h1>
		</center>
		<b>DEFINITION:-</b>
		Java Platform, Enterprise Edition or Java EE is Oracle's enterprise Java computing platform. The platform provides an API and runtime environment for developing and running enterprise software, including network and web services, and other large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications. Java EE extends the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE),[1] providing an API for object-relational mapping, distributed and multi-tier architectures, and web services. The platform incorporates a design based largely on modular components running on an application server. Software for Java EE is primarily developed in the Java programming language. The platform emphasizes Convention over configuration [2] and annotations for configuration. Optionally XML can be used to override annotations or to deviate from the platform defaults.
