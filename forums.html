		<b>History</b>

SQL was initially developed at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin, Donald C. Messerly, and Raymond F. Boyce in the early 1970s.[13] This version, initially called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language), was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's original quasi-relational database management system, System R, which a group at IBM San Jose Research Laboratory had developed during the 1970s.[14] The acronym SEQUEL was later changed to SQL because "SEQUEL" was a trademark of the UK-based Hawker Siddeley aircraft company.[15]
In the late 1970s, Relational Software, Inc. (now Oracle Corporation) saw the potential of the concepts described by Codd, Chamberlin, and Boyce and developed their own SQL-based RDBMS with aspirations of selling it to the U.S. Navy, Central Intelligence Agency, and other U.S. government agencies. In June 1979, Relational Software, Inc. introduced the first commercially available implementation of SQL, Oracle V2 (Version2) for VAX computers.
After testing SQL at customer test sites to determine the usefulness and practicality of the system, IBM began developing commercial products based on their System R prototype including System/38, SQL/DS, and DB2, which were commercially available in 1979, 1981, and 1983, respectively.[16]

<b>Language elements</b>

The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including:
Clauses, which are constituent components of statements and queries. (In some cases, these are optional.)[17]
Expressions, which can produce either scalar values, or tables consisting of columns and rows of data.
Predicates, which specify conditions that can be evaluated to SQL three-valued logic (3VL) (true/false/unknown) or Boolean truth values and which are used to limit the effects of statements and queries, or to change program flow.
Queries, which retrieve the data based on specific criteria. This is an important element of SQL.
Statements, which may have a persistent effect on schemata and data, or which may control transactions, program flow, connections, sessions, or diagnostics.
SQL statements also include the semicolon (";") statement terminator. Though not required on every platform, it is defined as a standard part of the SQL grammar.
Insignificant whitespace is generally ignored in SQL statements and queries, making it easier to format SQL code for readability.
