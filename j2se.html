		<h1><ul>JAVA TO STANDARD EDITION</ul></h1>
		</center>
		<b>DEFINITION:-</b>
		Java Platform, Standard Edition or Java SE is a widely used platform for development and deployment of portable applications for desktop and server environments.[1] Java SE uses the object-oriented Java programming language. Strictly speaking, Java SE is a platform specification. It defines a wide range of general purpose APIs—such as Java APIs for the Java Class Library[citation needed]—and also includes the Java Language Specification and the Java Virtual Machine Specification.[2] One of the most well-known implementations of Java SE is Oracle Corporation's Java Development Kit (JDK).[3]
