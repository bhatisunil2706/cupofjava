<h1 align="center">Java Book List</h1>

Here are some books currently in print and soon anticipated about Java.  
All books that are in print and which I've had
an opportunity to review get one of three ratings:
<dl>
<dt>Buy It
<dd>
An essential book for any Java programmer.

<dt>Browse It
<dd>
This book may be useful for some people. Skim through it in your local bookstore to see if you like it before laying out your cash.

<dt>Recycle It
<dd>
Toss it in the recycling bin.  <footnote>("Burn it" would have been more alliterative here,
but I have a general aversion to advocating book burning, even in jest.  
I also considered "bag it" and "barf on it" at which point I decided
alliteration wasn't that important.)</footnote>. 

</dl>

Note that these ratings are mutable depending on the competition and the
comparison between the book and the current release of Java.  Generally
a book's rating will go down over time except when a new edition is released.
For instance <cite>Java!</cite> by Tim Ritchey was a Buy It in August, 1995, 
a Browse It after the beta Java was released in November 1995, and was  
relegated to Recycle It status when <person>Laura Lemay's</person> 
book became available in January, 1996. Then the second edition came out, 
and the rating got raised back to Browse It.
<p>

<h2>My Favorite Java Books</h2>

I doubt it will surprise anyone that the books I like best 
are the ones I wrote.  Since I can't make any pretense to objectivity
about these, you'll have to make your own decisions about whether
these are Browse It's, Buy It's, or Recycle It's. 
<p>

<h3>Java I/O</h3>


<p>
Java's input and output libraries have been unfairly maligned
for some time. It is widely (but incorrectly) believed that
I/O in Java is a lot weaker and a lot harder than
I/O in traditional languages like C, C++, and Pascal.
If anything, however, the exact opposite is true.  
Java's I/O tools are far more
sophisticated, more powerful, and easier to use than 
traditional <code>printf()</code>/<code>scanf()</code> style I/O. 
</p>
Java's input and output (I/O) is based on streams. Streams
are a convenient metaphor for reading and writing data regardless
of whether that data comes from a file, a network connection,
the console, another thread, or some other source.
Furthermore streams can be filtered to perform
encryption, serialization, compression, translation,
and other services.
<p>


<cite> Java I/O</cite> tells you all you need to know about the four
 main categories of streams and uncovers less known features to
 help make your I/O operations more efficient. Plus, it shows you
 how to control number formatting, use characters aside from
  the standard ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing
truly multilingual software. 

<p>
Here are just a few of the topics covered in depth in <cite>Java I/O</cite>:
</p>

<ul>
<li>How to take advantage of the polymorphic nature of <code>InputStream</code> and <code>OutputStream</code>
<li>Files and network connections, the two most common sources of input and output
<li>Filter streams
<li>Reading and writing text
<li>Padding and aligning numbers
<li>Communicating with serial and parallel port devices
<li>The Java Cryptography Extension
<li>Object
Serialization
<li>Data Compression
<li>Writing file access code that works across platforms
<li>File dialogs in both the classic AWT and Swing
</ul>

<p>
And that's really just the beginning of what you'll learn from 
<cite>Java I/O</cite>.  I'm really happy with this book. 
In fact it's perhaps the first book I've written that I really feel reached its full potential.
I do hope you'll check it out. It's available
from  
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1565924851/cafeaulaitA/">amazon.com</a>, 
<a href="http://www.fatbrain.com/sqlnut/SP/search/gtsumt?source=&isbn=1565924851/">FatBrain</a>,
and other purveyors of fine computer books.
If you need to special order it, the ISBN number is 1-56592-485-1. 
It's $32.95, 596 pages, published by O'Reilly, and written by me, Elliotte
Rusty Harold.

<h3>JavaBeans: Developing Component 
Software in Java</h3>

<a href="books/beans/">
</a> 
My latest Java book, <strong><cite><a href=books/beans/">JavaBeans: Developing Component 
Software in Java</a></cite></strong>, 
is the first book in IDG's new Power Guide series.
  After reading this book I hope you'll agree with
me that beans are the wave of the future, and that they make Java
programming easier, more productive, and more fun.<p>

When I was finishing up my last book, <cite><a
href="books/secrets/">Java Secrets</a></cite>, John Osborn, one of
my editors at IDG, asked me what I thought would make a solid book for
IDG's new professional series. "Beans! Let me write about beans!" I
practically shouted. It was obvious, even then, that JavaBeans were
going to be hot, and that this is where Java was moving. It's four
months later; I know a lot more now about JavaBeans than I did then, and
I'm more convinced than ever that JavaBeans is going to be an essential
part of the future of Java, and indeed of the broader software
development world. This book is your introduction to the exciting and
fast-growing world of JavaBeans. With this book you'll learn how to write
your own unique beans that can be loaded into builder tools to quickly
produce powerful and customized applications. <p>

<cite>JavaBeans: Developing Component Software in Java</cite> is 355 pages, $39.95, and includes a <a href="books/beans/cd.html">CD</a>
with the JDK and the BDK (Beans Development Kit) as well as an assortment
of beans and builder tools. It's now in stock at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0764580523/cafeaulaitA/">Amazon</a>,
<a href="http://www.cbooks.com/sqlnut/SP/search/gtsumt?source=&isbn=0764580523">FatBrain</a>, and better bookstores everywhere. 
I've posted the <a href="books/beans/">preface</a>, 
<a href="books/beans/examples/">examples</a>, <a href="books/beans/index.html#toc">table of contents</a>,
and some other material here on
Cafe au Lait. Why don't you check out JavaBeans and let me know what you think?
<p>

<h3>Java Secrets</h3>


<strong><cite><a href="books/secrets/">Java Secrets</a></cite></strong> 
delves into the parts of Java that are
not documented by Sun, that are not generally accessible to anyone with
a web browser, and that are not already in a hundred other books.
Part One explores the internals of the Java virtual 
machine including byte code, thread models, garbage collection algorithms,
class loaders, security managers, and more. It teaches you how to disassemble
and decompile .class files so you too can learn things nobody wanted you to know.
Part Two delves into the <code>sun</code> classes, a group of undocumented packages
that add considerable power to Java programs. 
Part Three explores the possibilities opened by platform dependent code.
It shows you how to call the native API and how to create stand-alone
executable programs. Finally, the CD includes an assortment of Java hacking tools
including a full version of the payware Java 
decompiler <a href="http://www.wingsoft.com/wingdis.shtml">WingDIS</a>
2.0.3.<p>

This is one of the most interesting and exciting projects I've worked on 
in a long time. The sheer number of "Aha!" experiences I had while researching 
and writing this book was phenomenal. I hope you'll 
get the same feeling while reading it. 
 <a href="books/secrets/index.html">Java Secrets</a>,
is now available at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0764580078/cafeaulaitA/">amazon.com</a>
and in bookstores everywhere. 
Why don't you 
check it out and let me know what you think? 
<p>
<br clear=all>

<h3>Java Network Programming</h3>


My second book, 
<strong><cite><a href="books/jnp/">Java Network Programming</a></cite></strong>, is now available
from O'Reilly &amp; Associates. Most of what is new and exciting
about Java centers around the potential for new kinds of dynamic,
networked applications, and  <cite>Java Network Programming</cite> 
shows you how to write them.  This book combines
a general introduction to application layer network programming
 with complete coverage of Java's networking classes. No prior experience
 with network programming is assumed. Among other topics you'll learn about
 sockets, server sockets, UDP and TCP traffic, Internet addresses,
 URLs, HTTP, HTML, protocol handlers, content handlers,
 multicast sockets, and how all of these are handled in Java. 
<p>

Manning Publications has also recently published a book titled 
<cite>Java Network Programming</cite>.  It's not a bad book, and is 
surprisingly orthogonal to mine. About 2/3 of that book is
streams and encryption which I only touch on. My book
covers servlets, applets, multicast sockets, and Java 1.1
which that book doesn't discuss in any depth. The matching 
titles appear to be just unlucky choices.
Both publishers went with the most obvious title they could think of. 
However the cover of the Manning book has a big fish,
and looks  suspiciously like an O'Reilly book.  
Don't be fooled.  The real O'Reilly book has either a gyroscope
or a chameleon
on the cover (two different covers, same book).  
<p>
Java Network Programming is $34.95, ISBN number 1-56592-227-1,
and is available now from any bookstore that stocks computer books
including
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN%3D1565922271/">amazon.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.cbooks.com/sqlnut/SP/search/gtsumt%3Fsource%3D%26isbn=1565922271">Computer

<h3>The Java Developer's Resource</h3>


 <strong><cite><a href="books/jdr/">The Java
Developer's Resource</a></cite></strong> is my first book, and still in some ways
my favorite. (You always remember your first one, after all.)
The JDR is a comprehensive introduction to Java 1.0 for
programmers.  It covers the Java language from the ground up as well
as the AWT including threads, layout managers, exceptions, event
handling, data structures, input and output, and a lot more.   I
started writing this book when there weren't any good books on Java.
In many ways this is the book I wish had been available a year ago
when I was trying to learn Java.  <p>

Unfortunately the JDR is out of print.  I am currently 
updating the book with everything that's happened and
everything I've learned about Java in the last four years, and will release it online again soon.
In the meantime, used copies are easily available from 
<a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0135707897/cafeaulaitA/">amazon.com</a>
and other sources of used books.

<h2> My Top Ten Favorite Java Books (that I didn't write)</h2>

A few months ago O'Reilly and Associates asked to list my top ten favorite Java books. 
At the time there weren't really ten I liked, but some better ones have
come out since. Now, I think I can just manage to pick my favorite ten. 
In no particular order they are<p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://www.osborne.com/int/javah.htm">The Java Handbook</a>
<dd> by Patrick Naughton, Michael Morrison
<ul>
<li>Publisher: Osborne/McGraw-Hill 
<li>ISBN: 0-078-82199-1
<li>Pages: 424
<li>Price: $27.95
<li>Publication Date: April, 1996
<li>Bottom Line: In Print
</ul><p>
This is the first Java book that gave me the feeling that the author actually understood and
was comfortable with the material. This is probably because Naughton's been working with Java longer than almost anyone, having been part of the original Green Project. Whether it's explaining what a Factory is or why they're so many do-nothing methods in <code>java.net.URLConnection</code>, you believe he actually knows this stuff. By comparison everyone else seems to be learning as they go along. The epilogue about the genesis of Java is particularly unique and fascinating (though not always accurate. I can't imagine he really had a Newton to critique in 1991). After reading this you'll be amazed that Java really happened.<p>

<li>Price: $39.95
<li>Publication Date: April, 1997
<li>Bottom Line: Buy It
</ul><p>
This large gem of a book is often overlooked
in favor of the second volume of the The Java Class Libraries: An Annotated Reference.
However in many respects I think this is the superior book. While, 
Chan and Lee
is more comprehensive and more likely to explain some particular obscure method, Zukowski
does a much better job of showing you the broader picture of how the different parts of 
the AWT fit together and how they're properly used. For example,
so far this is the only book I've read that correctly explains 
modal dialogs. <p>
<dt><a href="http://java.sun.com/doc/language_specification.html">The Java Language Specification</a>
<dd> by James Gosling , Bill Joy, Guy Steele
<ul>
<li>Publisher: Addison-Wesley
<li>ISBN: 0-201-63451-1
<li>Pages: 720
<li>Price: $31.05
<li>Publication Date: September, 1996
<li>Bottom Line: Browse It
</ul><p>
For experts only. This book is full of turgid paragraphs like:  <p>
<blockquote>
The arguments in the argument list, if any, are used to select a constructor declared in the body of the named class type, using the same matching rules as for method invocations (15.11), a compile-time method matching error results if there is no unique constructor that is both applicable to the provided arguments and the most specific of all the applicable constructors.
</blockquote>

(p. 314) I generally have to read something at least three times before I understand what is being said. However, the Java Language Specification is often the only place where you can find out why your code won't compile. You don't need this book often, and you certainly can't learn Java from it; but when you need it, you need it badly. Fortunately it's available online so I recommend you view it there, and only buy a copy if you find you make frequent recourse to it.<p>
<dt><a href="http://64.78.49.204/">Thinking in Java</a>
<dd> by Bruce Eckel
<ul>
<li>Publisher: Prentice Hall
<li>ISBN: 0-136-59723-8
<li>Pages: 1152

<li>Publication Date: December, 1998
<li>Bottom Line: Buy It
</ul><p>
It's unusual for me to put in my Top Ten list before it's released, but this one deserves it. Thinking in Java is my favorite introduction to Java for experienced
programmers.  Eckel is an expert on object oriented programming, and this expertise
shows in the book. Where most authors books treat classes and objects
as extra features of a basically procedural language, Eckel sees them as the
fundamental underpinnings of code design they really are.
Unlike many other tutorials this isn't simply a port to a new
language of the same Basic/Pascal/Fortran/C book the 
author's been writing and rewriting for the last twenty years.

<ul>
<li>Publisher: AP Professional
<li>ISBN: 0-123-39101-6
<li>Pages: 372
<li>Price: $39.95
<li>Bottom Line: Buy It
</ul><p>
This book is the best introduction yet to Java for non-programmers. It is very well-written and exceptionally easy-to-read. In fact it reads much like a novel or good non-fiction. This is probably due to the unusual way it was written, with constant feedback from a Java novice and almost complete programming novice (Heller's wife). Points that other books tend to gloss over but that confuse novices, Heller covers in detail, and in a surprisingly refreshing conversational fashion. In fact, email dialogs with his wife are scattered throughout the book. This sounds weird, but it really, really works. Even though I certainly know almost all the material covered here (essentially Java syntax basics with no AWT, networking, or applets) I still found it an amusing read. I often disagree with Heller's interpretations of tricky issues like whether using the + sign to concatenate strings violates some unspoken prohibition in Java against operator overloading. However, these are minor quibbles and in no way interfere with the high level of readability of this book.<p>

If you like Kernighan and Ritchie, you'll like this book. It covers the Java language and most of the java.lang package with little to no discussion of the AWT. It also includes exercises to help you get started with Java, a feature sorely lacking in most other books.<p>

This book is the first good book about Java for people who want to learn to program but have never programmed before. In fact it might make a decent text for an "Intro to Programming" class. The chapters are clear, short and well-written. It would benefit from some exercises so new programmers can test their skills, but otherwise it's flawless and quite reasonably priced.

This book describes how to do graphics that go beyond the normal AWT including 3D and VRML. It really puts the lie to Dimension X's claim that you have to use native methods to add VRML to Java. If you want to learn more about computer graphics than merely the different API calls, this is a great place to start.<p>

This book tries to cover too much too fast. For example a single chapter attempts to cover network basics, sockets, and UDP. Other chapters cover RMI, CORBA and IDL, JDBC, the Java Web Server and more. Each of these more than justifies a book of its own. This book provides extremely fast overviews of these and other topics, but most readers will want a more comprehensive and in-depth look at each of these. <p>

This book provides an introduction to Java and object-oriented programming. Just Java covers all the basics and describes the elements of window and network programming in Java. As readers of his previous book, <cite>Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets</cite>, will expect van der Linden enlivens the text and examples with good humor and interesting asides. So far this is the only Java book I've seen that was actually fun to read as opposed to merely informative. The CD-ROM contains the Java Development Kit 1.0 for Solaris, Win32 and the Mac. It also contains all the examples, code and applets from all the Sunsoft Press Java books, that is <cite>Core Java</cite>, <cite>Java by Example</cite>, <cite>Instant Java</cite>, and <cite>Just Java</cite>.<p>

This book is a comprehensive programming guide for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The book is divided into two sections: the first section includes information on the semantics and structure of the JVM; the second section is a reference of the JVM instructions, or "opcodes." This book is intended to give readers a strong overview and reference of the JVM so that they may create their own implementations of the JVM, or write their own compilers that create Java object code. The programming guide includes numerous examples written in Java assembly language. A Java assembler is provided with the book, so the examples can all be compiled and executed. The reference section is a complete description of the instruction set of the VM and the class file format, including a description of the byte-code verifier.<p>

I was really looking forward to this book. I think a book on object oriented design with Java as the central language is a natural. However, I regret to inform you that the authors' writing style is the dryest, most boring I have ever encountered. Even though I really needed to understand the material discussed here, I couldn't stomach more than about ten pages of this, and this from someone who reads advanced physics texts for fun!<p>

This book has stirred a lot of controversy among the distributed object community. The consensus seems to be that it does a good job with CORBA and IDL, but not so great with RMI and DCOM. However this particular community isn't one known for rational, unbiased, objective discussions in the first place so that's no great surprise. In any case, whether you love it or hate it you should read it.<p>

This book has the best explanations I've seen yet of how to use the AWT, content and protocol handlers and more. The book is a little on the long and expensive side, the writing could do with some improvement, and some later chapters on Javascript could have been safely dropped. However it's technically impeccable, covers many details that are only touched on or ignored completely in other books, and is overall an incredibly useful book.  The CD-ROM includes the usual selection of applets and source code as well as Sun's JDK 1.0.1 for the usual platforms.<p>

Peter Coffee tried to write a book that would be useful for people who wanted to learn Java but who had never programmed before. This is an immensely difficult task. I doubt programming is a skill most people can learn solely through a book. Therefore it shouldn't be surprising that he failed. Coffee covers too much, too fast. Advanced topics and tools like overflow, assembly language, binary arithmetic, and source code control systems are covered before readers get to write their first program. Furthermore, the book contains more than a few mistakes in code that an experienced programmers could probably identify and work-around, but which will completely stymie novices. Finally, and most annoyingly, Coffee's treatment is Windows specific. Macintosh and Unix users are completely ignored.<p>

This is a weak book that tries to combine two topics (designing Intranets and Java) that really deserve separate books. Coverage of individual topics is scant, and chapter after chapter I'm left wanting more. Furthermore, at least one auther has an annoying habit of playing fast and loose with the facts. It is not true that "Trillions of research dollars went into developing the Internet." (p. 4) Nor is it acceptable for a reference work to confuse the meaning of terms like class and object or member and instance variable.<p>

This version of the best-selling Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days has seven more days (chapters) than the original edition, but they're not written by Laura Lemay; and, cover copy not withstanding, they don't cover Java 1.1. The claim that the book contains the "Latest version of Sun's JDK for Windows 95, Windows NT, and the Macintosh" is also false. Finally, despite the fact that this is the "Professional Reference Edition," this book is very much a tutorial and not a reference. In the final analysis this book is very much not worth $59.95.<p>

This is the same tutorial available online at Javasoft. It's also avilable there in Postscript format. While this book is well written and easy to follow, it does suffer from trying to create a book from a hypertext document. It's clear that where the needs of hypertext and the needs of a paper book conflicted, the hypertext took precedence and that hypertext is where the authors hearts were. Therefore I suggest you read the copy on the web, and leave the book on store shelves.<p>

This book adheres to the philosophy of more is better, in particular more pages (over 900!) and more money ($45). Foundations of Java is quite well-written and has a friendly, first person, conversational tone; but the same material could certainly have been communicated in half the page count. The book begins with more than two hundred pages of fluff about the history of the Internet and Java propaganda everyone's heard a thousand times before. The rest of the book is filled with pointless digressions about topics like how a French press can improve your coffee. This book desperately needs a good editor to cut it down to a reasonable size.  If you aren't really in a hurry to learn Java, then this book may be for you; but you can certainly learn Java more quickly with one of the other available texts.  The CD-ROM includes the 1.0.1 JDK and the usual sample code.<p>

This is a good book for people who are comfortable in C++ to learn Java.

This is a good second book about Java. The first couple of chapters are a nice review of basic Java syntax (though insufficient to actually learn the language from). The remainder of the book covers fairly advanced topics like the AWT, Networking, and Images. The examples in these chapters are decidedly non-trivial. The discussion of Images and Image filters is the best I've seen anywhere. However the end of the book is brought down by a chapter on HotJava that is completely out of date (1.0 alpha 3!?). Hopefully this flaw will be corrected in future editions.<p>

This book is an update to the bestselling Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days. This edition assumes you're usinc Symantec's Cafe IDE for Windows (but not the Mac). It adds some coverage of JDBC and the network classes to the original book, and removes the chapter on native methods. A few of the more egregious errors of the first edition have been corrected like the /, &lt;= and &gt;= signs. Finally the entire book has been rewritten to focus on Cafe. If you're using Cafe (though I certainly recommend against that), then this is a worthwhile book from which to learn Java.<p>

This is the first book to cover Sun's Java Workshop IDE, only in alpha 5 as of this writing. Given that state of development, this book is very premature. Java workshop hasn't matured or stabilized enough yet to be a useful tool, much less a product books can be written about it without being obsolete when they hit the shelves.  This book manages to pull off the difficult feat of being simultaneously too simple and too adavanced. It begins with a 40 page review of HTML, and yet has almost nothing to say about basic Java syntakx like <code>for</code> loops. This book shows all the signs of being rushed to market prematurely. The source code has curly quotes; the diagrams are ASCII art, and the whole book is simply not very useful for anyone.<p>

I had hoped Exploring Java would be the definitive introduction to Java from
      O'Reilly; but while it's certainly a good book, I fear it assumes too much of the
      reader. In particular, the book is aimed at people with a solid background in C or
      C++ programming and a much better than average understanding of how C relates
      to assembly. Exploring Java is definitely not for novices or even Visual Basic or
      Smalltalk programmers. In fact the authors go so far as to suggest that if you don't
      already know C, then you should learn it before learning Java. This was a common
      refrain in 1995, but I thought we'd moved beyond that. If you aren't a C expert,
      look elsewhere. It's not that a book at this level is necessarily bad. It's just that
      O'Reilly already published one such book, the bestselling Java in a Nutshell. I had
      hoped Exploring Java would be more different. <p>

      On the other hand if you are a C expert, or if you've mastered the basics of the Java
      language at the level of Gosling's The Java Programming Language, then this book
      is exceptionally well written. Niemeyer and Peck took their time on this book and it
      shows. Furthermore O'Reilly put about a thousand times more effort into this book
      than is common in the industry. The biniding is good and lays flat. The illustrations
      were redrawn by a professional illustrator rather than merely photostating the
      author's own crude drawings. In these and a dozen other ways, this looks and reads
      like a quality book. If only it didn't assume quite so much of the reader. <p>

This book has three parts. The first is an introduction to Java programming that's too short and quick to be of any real use to anyone. The second part contains several well-commented examples. Particularly interesting are the marginal notes commenting on the code. It's as if someone marked all over the code with pen on paper, and it really helps. I've never seen anything like it before in a programming book. I'd love to know how the authors snuck that by the production editors at Macmillan who are renowned for their fanatical attachment to their standard style sheet. Unfortunately as striking as the mere presence of the marginal notes is, the notes themselves aren't very well written. The third part is a brief catalog of about twenty applets enclosed on the bundled CD-ROM. A few like ImageMap are useful. However most are of the the "Control Nuclear Power Plant" or "Frog's Light Snack" ilk, cute but not relevant to any web page but the author's. Most and perhaps all of these are freely available on the net.<p>

Does anyone know why Que's Using series is so popular? If so will you please explain it to me. I confess that I find virtually all of these books to be written purely by-the-numbers, and Using Java is no exception. It was tossed together by about twenty different authors of widely varying ability. Some chapters are fine. Some chapters are awful. I suspect at least one author was just rewriting material from Java Unleashed because he copied that book's mistakes too. The complete text is available online which is a somewhat redeeming feature though.<p>

This book and the included CD-ROM provides a variety of applets, such as text manipulation, sound, animation, etc., and shows users how to easily plug them into existing web pages. Directions on how to customize these applets to suit specific needs are in the book. This book should be immensely useful to web site designers. It includes many interesting, original and customizable applets you can use to spice up a page. However it has little to interest programmers who want to write their own applets (aside from ideas to copy and be inspired by).  The CD-ROM contains the Java Development Kit 1.0.2 for Solaris, Win32, and the Mac. It also contains all the examples, code and applets from Core Java, Java by Example, Instant Java, and Just Java.<p>

Presenting Java is very heavy on the philosophy and purpose of Java and very light on practical information. It certainly doesn't have very much information to help you learn to program in Java. It may be a useful book to give your bosses to explain why they should drop $10,000 on a Solaris box so you can play with Java.<p>

Half of this book is a poorly designed reference to the AWT, which appears to half been tossed in just to easily bulk up the page count. In fact much of this book seems to be nothing more than a quick way to fill space. The CD-ROM does not include Visual J++. It's just a load of shovelware unrelated to the content of the book. To top it all off, what little original content there is seems to be based on laughable Microsoft propaganda. For example "ActiveX controls are a good and necessary component to a strongly Internet influenced language like Java" (p. 232) and "ActiveX controls are designed to be cross-platform" (p. 232). Last I checked there were exactly zero cross-platform ActiveX controls, and other platforms did just fine without them. This is possibly the worst Java book I have seen yet. Where other books in the "Recycle It" category mostly commit sins of omission, this one is just downright wrong.<p>

This is the best book yet about Visual J++, for what that's worth (not much). The discussion of Active X is particularly good. However, in 1996, can you believe that when half the books on the market have CD's and most have Web sites, some people are still trying to pull the "Send us $25 for a disk of code" scam? Well, some people are; and the authors of this book are among them.<p>

I suppose that it's no surprise that authors who choose to write about Visual J++ in preference to the dozens of other possible Java related topics tend to be Microsoft sycophants. Nonetheless that doesn't make their brown-nosing any less annoying. For example, consider this statement from page 296: "Of course, one has to admit that Microsoft produces some of the best software in the world. " I admit no such thing, and many others feel as I do. Given the author's general attitude it shouldn't be any surprise that cross-platform issues are completely ignored in this book.<p>

The first edition was an excellent introduction to Java for C programmers, an excellent reference for everyone, and a bargain at $19.95.
The second still is, but it's
been updated to cover all of the new features in Java 1.1.
It contains an introduction to key Java concepts, descriptions of all
of the classes in the core Java 1.1 API,  a detailed description of
the syntax of the Java language, and an advanced
introduction to Java for C and C++ programmers who want to  get
up to speed with Java quickly.  
<p>
The new Java 1.1 material in "Java in a Nutshell, 2nd Edition"
includes:<p>
<ul>
<li>A detailed overview of all of the new features in Java 1.1, both on a
  package-by-package basis and in terms of overall functionality.
<li>A comprehensive tutorial on "inner classes" that explains how to use
  all of the new types of inner classes: static member classes, member
  classes, local classes, and anonymous classes.
<li>Practical, real-world example programs that demonstrate the new
  features in Java 1.1, including object serialization, the new AWT
  event handling model, internationalization, and a sample Java Bean.
<li>A complete quick reference for all of the classes, methods, and
  variables in the core Java 1.1 API. The quick-reference pages include
  indicators that make it easy to find the new 1.1 material.

Java and databases make a powerful combination. Java lends itself to portable interfaces and reuse, while databases serve up the riches stored by a corporation or other organization. Getting the two sides to work together, however, takes some fiddling -- largely because Java deals in objects while most databases are not object oriented. This book describes the standard Java interfaces that make portable, object-oriented access to relational databases possible, and offers a robust model for writing applications that are easy to maintain. It covers the JDBC and RMI packages and uses them to develop three-tier applications (applications divided into a user interface, an object-oriented logic component, and an information store). Virtually all the important database providers have drivers to support JDBC. If you have a database at your site and know some Java, this book will help you become a more effective application developer for Java database programs. It shows you how to embed SQL commands into a Java program using the JDBC APIs, and how to break your application into interfaces and classes that maximize the opportunities for reuse and easy maintenance. You also learn how to find servers through the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) interface and to use an object broker. This is a book that can truly pull your computing site together. It includes a comprehensive three-tier database example and reference listings for JDBC and the most important RMI classes. Covers Java 1.1.<p>

This is a moderately interesting book. The chapters on Bezier curves ansd solid modeling are good. However, I question the wisdom of giving equal time to things that are fully supported in the AWT (like drawing lines and ovals) to things that are not (Bezier curves). I would much prefer more pages spent on the more advanced topics and fewer on the basics which are adequately covered in many other books. <p>

As Java books go, this book has a surprising amount of math. It's the first one I've seen to use a derivative, for example. However I think there's too much math for the non-mathematical readers and not enough for mathematically oriented readers.  I also would have preferred more in-depth discussions of the logic behind and reasons for the formulas Stevens presents. <p>

The Java Fundamental Classes Reference provides complete reference documentation on the core Java classes that comprise the <code>java.lang</code>, <code>java.io</code>, <code>java.net</code>, and <code>java.util</code> packages. These classes provide general-purpose functionality that is fundamental to every Java application. This edition describes Version 1.1 of the Java Developer's Kit. The Java Fundamental Classes Reference includes reference material on every core Java class and provides sample code to help you learn by example.<p>

Viewed in isolation, this isn't a bad book; but it's not as good the Addison-Wesley books that cover the same material, nor does it add that much to what's freely available online. <p>

I have a general aversion to "FAQ" lists that are only available as payware rather than being made freely available on the net for all to learn from. The entire text of this book really shoud be on Sun's Web site. Nonetheless, I must admit it's a useful book. The questions are taken from those programmers have sent to java@java.sun.com, and are reasonably representative of what I see on Usenet and hear from my students. There are a few notable omissions (there's no discussion of formatted output, for example) and some of the answers hew too closely to the Sun line to be fully answered (for instance, the frequent question about playing audio in applications is answered by saying it's simply not possible with no reference to the sun.audio package). However, despite these shortcomings this is still a useful book. <p>

This book is perhaps the first undergraduate data structures text that uses Java as the implemenattion language rather than C, Pascal, or some other more traditional language. The material is covered in that recommeneded my the ACM's recommeneded curriculum for CS 2; i.e. abstract data types, sorting, searching, hash functions, linked lists, trees, tries, stacks, queues, and so on. If  you're teaching such a course, this is a completely adequate choice of course text. It's not bad for self-study of these topics either. <p>

<cite>Netscape IFC in a Nutshell</cite> is a desktop quick reference and
programmer's guide to the Internet Foundation Classes (Version 1.1)
from Netscape. The
book features a quick reference plus more than 20
tutorial-style, example-based chapters that introduce each of the
features and GUI components of the IFC. These features include:<p>

<ul>
<li>A "Pure Java" platform-independent, customizable look-and-feel,
   with a complete suite of GUI components
 <li>Intra-application drag-and-drop
 <li>Multi-font formatted text display, with a built-in HTML parser
 <li>Pre-defined color, font, and file-selection dialog boxes
 <li>Timer objects that simplify animation by replacing threads
 <li>Netscape IFC Constructor, a free interface builder application freely available
   from Netscape
</ul>

The IFC 1.1 library is freely available on the Internet, for use in any
Java application or with any Java-capable web browser, and is bundled
with Netscape's Navigator 4.0 web browser. Furthermore,
the Netscape IFC classes documented in "Netscape IFC in a Nutshell"
will strongly influence the development of the Java Foundation Classes
(JFC), under development by Sun, Netscape, IBM, and others. The JFC
will reportedly merge IFC technology with Sun's AWT GUI toolkit.
Although the JFC will eventually supersede the IFC, the IFC is a
powerful class library, is available now, and is a very useful and
stable predecessor to the JFC. Netscape has committed to providing a migration path to the
JFC, when it becomes available, so experience now with the IFC will
give programmers a head start on the JFC.

Beans make Java simpler.  Using a visual builder tool like Borland's JBuilder or IBM's VisualAge for Java (not discussed in the book), 
developers can connect several beans together and make an
application, without actually writing any Java code--in fact, without
doing any programming at all.<p>

"Developing Java Beans" explains how to write classes that are
serializable, use events for communication between classes, know when
and how to provide BeanInfo classes that give graphical environments
more information about components, and provide property editors and
customizers that let graphical tools work with more complex  beans, and
use beans as ActiveX controls. <p>

Beans is moving quickly, and this book is already out of date. Since no real builder
tools were available when this book was being written, the discussion is almost exclusively
about how to code beans, with little coverage of how to combine beans into applets and applications.  Nonetheless as of September, 1997 this is probably the best book currently in print on JavaBeans and is a good place to start if you want to develop your own bean components.<p>

This book is little more than page after page of listings of the signatures of various methods in various classes. Few examples are provided, and in general there's almost no explanation about what these methods do. It's pretty obvious that the material wsa shoe-horned into a particular page count, into which it really couldn't fit. The much longer reference books from Addison-Wesley are much more useful. <p>

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a third generation method for specifying, visualizing, and documenting an object-oriented system under development. It unifies the three leading
object-oriented methods and others to serve as the basis for a common, stable, and expressive
object-oriented development notation. As the complexity of software applications increases, so does the developer's need to design and analyze applications before developing them. This practical introduction to UML provides software developers with an overview of this powerful new design notation, and teaches Java programmers to analyse and design object-oriented applications using the UML notation. <p>

<li>Bottom Line: Recycle It
</ul><p>
This is probably the best-written book I've ever given a Recycle It rating to. The problem here isn't the writing or the technical accuracy. It's the topics that are (and more importantly aren't) covered. In the preface, Oaks says "what I really wanted to talk about was how an applet could be allowed to read a file." Unfortunately, he doesn't actually get to that topic until the appendixes; and even there he only discusses it in the context of HotJava, the JDK, and the applet viewer. If you want to know how to get an applet to read a file in Netscape or IE, you'll have to go to Netscape's and Microsoft's Web sites respectively. You won't find that inforamtion here. While the book does cover Java 1.2's security classes quite thoroughly, it doesn't have much of practical value to Web devleopers who just want their applets to read files.<p>

This is the same tutorial available online at Javasoft. It's also avilable there in Postscript format. While this book is well written and easy to follow, it does suffer from trying to create a book from a hypertext document. It's clear that where the needs of hypertext and the needs of a paper book conflicted, the hypertext took precedence and that hypertext is where the authors hearts were. Therefore I suggest you read the copy on the web, and leave the book on store shelves.<p>

For experienced programmers, this books covers both the fundamentals and the advanced tips and tricks of the experts. It provides coverage of all Java features and syntax as well as Visual Basic and C/C++ tips that compare and contrast features of Java to those languages.  This book is very Windows specific. Macs are covered in an appendix. Unix and OS/2 are hardly mentioned.<p>

This book and the included CD-ROM provides a variety of applets, such as text manipulation, sound, animation, etc., and shows users how to easily plug them into existing web pages. Directions on how to customize these applets to suit specific needs are in the book. This book should be immensely useful to web site designers. It includes many interesting, original and customizable applets you can use to spice up a page. However it has little to interest programmers who want to write their own applets (aside from ideas to copy and be inspired by). A second edition is planned soon so you may wish to wait for that.  The CD-ROM contains the Java Development Kit 1.0 for Solaris, Win32 and the Mac. It also contains all the examples, code and applets from all the Sunsoft Press Java books, that is Core Java, Java by Example, Instant Java, and Just Java.<p>

Does anyone know why Que's Using series is so popular? If so will you please explain it to me. I confess that I find virtually all of these books to be written purely by-the-numbers, and Using Java is no exception. It was tossed together by about twenty different authors of widely varying ability. Some chapters are fine. Some chapters are awful. I suspect at least one author was just rewriting material from Java Unleashed because he copied that book's mistakes too. The complete text is available online which is a somewhat redeeming feature though.<p>

</dl><h2>Other Good Books</h2>

Java's quite new. There are many books that will be useful
to Java programmers that do not explicitly mention Java.
All the books in this section are excellent books that I find myself making frequent
reference to. However they are not Java specific.<p>

Unlike the other lists, this list does not try to be comprehensive.
It is a list of a few of the best books, not all the books available.
Books are only added to this list if I actually possess a copy and have found it
to be useful. Unlike Java books, I do not actively seek out books in this category.
If you're a publisher or author and think your book might fit in here,
I suggest you send me a copy. (Send 
<a href="mailto:elharo@sunsite.unc.edu">email</a> to find out where to send it.)<p>
